The Powder Toy Application Platform Interface
====================================
Release Version 0.1
====================================

This Node.js version of TPTAPI allows you to seamlessly integrate user logins from The Powder Toy community. This authentication system works like Facebook and their application system. By clicking a simple button, the user is redirected to us for authentication. Then sent back to your site with a special key to show they have been authenticated. 

We do have plans for other package types. Just be patient.

There is a PDF instruction booklet that will go through setting up the package.
